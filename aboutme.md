My name is Kal. You'll find me operating in the Boston/Cambridge areas. I enjoy parolling in art studios, etc. Some of the other activities I enjoy are:

- Music, making my own beats cos I'm dope!!
- Being loyal to my squad


### My Journey

It's a bit long but hey, why don't you catch me during one of my performances in the area. See here for a schedule of some of my up-coming arts. Also, check out some of works, [audio casts] (https://soundcloud.com/kuvie/k3-ke-mi) and [notes](http://obanko01.github.io/).
