Engineer, Tech Lover and aspiring expressionist.
You'll find me biking the streets of Somerville, Cambridge on Boston during the summer and hibernating straight from the holes of Prospect Hill in the Winter.

I enjoy picking up new hobbies. Here is a couple of summer hit lists:
- brushing up my piano skills (I'm not sure if brush up is the right word, the honest truth is I've always sucked at black and white.)
- refining summer hip hop skills (used to Dance hip hop so many years ago!)
- follow me on Instagram and Twitter if you're curious about the rest of the list.




### My Journey

It's a bit long but hey, why don't you catch me during one of my performances in the area. See here for a schedule of some of my up-coming arts. Also, check out some of works, [audio casts](https://soundcloud.com/kuvie/k3-ke-mi) and [notes](http://obanko01.github.io/).
