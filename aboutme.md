Engineer, Tech Lover and aspiring expressionist. You’ll find me biking the streets of Somerville, Cambridge and Boston during the summer, and hibernating/working it out from the holes of Prospect Hill in the Winter when it starts to get real.

I also enjoy picking up new hobbies. Here is a couple of summer hit lists:

- brushing up my piano skills (I’m not sure if brush up is the right word, the honest truth is I’ve always sucked at black and white keys) 
- refining summer hip hop skills (used to Dance hip hop so many years ago!) 
- follow me on Instagram and Twitter if you’re curious about the rest of the list.

### My Journey

It's a bit long but hey, maybe one of these days I'll write something about it here. If you need to reach me, you'll find my contact information in the footer below.
