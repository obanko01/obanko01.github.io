Engineer, Tech Lover and aspiring expressionist. You’ll find me biking the streets of Somerville, Cambridge and Boston during the summer, and hibernating/working it out from the holes of Prospect Hill in the Winter when it starts to get real.

I also enjoy picking up new hobbies. Here is a couple of summer hit lists:

- brushing up my piano skills (I’m not sure if brush up is the right word, the honest truth is I’ve always sucked at black and white keys) 
- refining summer hip hop skills (used to Dance hip hop so many years ago!) 
- follow me on Instagram and Twitter if you’re curious about the rest of the list.

### My Journey

It's a bit long but hey, maybe one of these days I'll write something about it here but in the meantime, feel free to reach me. You'll find my contact information in the footer below.
Side note, see here for a schedule of some of my up-coming arts. Also, check out some of works, [audio casts](https://soundcloud.com/kuvie/k3-ke-mi) and [notes](http://obanko01.github.io/).
