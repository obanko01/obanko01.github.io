The English Premier League


Many say it's the most watched league in the world but that really fails to capture the essence of the premier league. The EPL has got to be the most interesting league in the world. From Leicester's renowned feat in the 2015/2016 season to the resurging shake-up of the big wigs consisting Chelsea, Man City and Man United, to the promise of the rekindling rivalry between the self-acclaimed special one and the probably more special one, and the list goes on, the coming season is shaping up as one to remember. Tottenham will be formidable given their long stretch of form last season, Arsenal will come back re-inforced, Klopp's Liverpool will be deadly, Leicester will remain relevant but unlikely to reproduce last season's form and West Ham, will they continue the surprise hammer?

It'll be rather preposterous to punt on the future here and for that reason, let us pour some libation to the gods of soccer who have made this promising season possible. I know it's too early to call but anyway, a toast to what appears to be a potentially great year for English Soccer. The question here isn't whether it'll be exciting or not; the conundrum here is just how close will it be. Let the punting begin ... elsewhere.
