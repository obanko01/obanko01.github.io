I have been grateful to work on a number of projects over the last couple of years. Ranging from the entrpreneurial kind to the mundane, each of these projects had its own appeal. Here a number of them. Hopefully, when I find more time on my hand, I'll post more about some of these projects here.
Some of them include:

 - Building visualization tool in Excel VBA (Used BP's dataset spanning almost 20 years)
 -- Yes you can do some pretty amazing effects in Excel
 - A transport web app (turns out [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) was once step ahead of my group and I)
 - Cost Optimization and design of levulinic acid production
 -- Used SuperPro and Aspen for optimization
 - Robot (an ongoing project)
 - Novels (I definitely plan to publish some of my short stories here ...)

I'll continue to add more as they come. Stay posted.
